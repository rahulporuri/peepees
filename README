the program can be run by doing
$ python main.py

Note
-----
1) Before ticking a box, make sure that the other box is unticked.
2) As before, the plots need to be closed so that changes 
made in the traitsUI editor are used to update the plots.
3) The individual models can be run on their own, by doing 
$ python foo_vis.py
after having commented the last two lines that create 
an instance of the class and call the configure_traits() method
on the instance.

To be added
------------
1) More physics modules.
2) Additional item in the traitsUI that 
contains information on which module is selected 
and the parameter set being used, instead of
printing the same to stdout, on the terminal.
3) Updating or redrawing matplotlib canvas
instead of replotting.

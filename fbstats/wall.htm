Evolution of human perception of the jobs that robots (can) do...

1. A robot/computer cannot possibly do the tasks I do.
[Later.]

2. OK, it can do a lot of them, but it can’t do everything I do.
[Later.]

3. OK, it can do everything I do, except it needs me when it breaks down, which is often.
[Later.]

4. OK, it operates flawlessly on routine stuff, but I need to train it for new tasks.
[Later.]

5. OK, it can have my old boring job, because it’s obvious that was not a job that humans were meant to do.
[Later.]

6. Wow, now that robots are doing my old job, my new job is much more fun and pays more!
[Later.]

7. I am so glad a robot/computer cannot possibly do what I do now.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, April 24, 2013 at 2:10am UTC+05:30</div>Venugopal Rao shared a photo to your Timeline.<div class="comment">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=493358167403274&amp;set=a.414754115263680.94958.414753515263740&amp;type=1&amp;theater</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, April 22, 2013 at 3:56pm UTC+05:30</div>Rahul Poruri updated his cover photo.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, April 22, 2013 at 3:52pm UTC+05:30</div>Rahul Poruri added work to his timeline.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, April 22, 2013 at 2:43pm UTC+05:30</div><div class="comment">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, April 22, 2013 at 1:31am UTC+05:30</div><div class="comment">Sanjay - you have gott to read this! reverse engineering at it&#039;s best!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, April 21, 2013 at 4:05pm UTC+05:30</div><div class="comment">Sivaramakrishnan, my thoughts as to the role of excel in the recent debacle are roughly emulated here - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22213219 because i used to think that human actions are what cause errors, not machines. and then i read this - http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~bdm25/excel2007.pdf .

The number of post about the apocalypse are still pretty darn high but the pundits say that this will slowly subside and people will start looking at pictures of cats again. 
Human civilization and mentality in general still the remain same, happy about the hyped up pseudo-apocalypse not having happened while they keep disregarding the real danger - global warming, poverty and illiteracy. 
Any hopes of the changes in the human mind set are bleak looking at the *post-(pseudo)-apocalyptic* experience!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus,_2012 - the last venus transit of the century! starting after sunrise tomorrow i.e 6th June and lasting till 10 AM.  

for those who do know but dont know how to observe - 
&gt; donot observe naked eye! (duh). 
&gt; try procuring some sun goggles 
&gt; try meeting someone from local observatory or amateur astronomy club. 
&gt; try projecting the sun using a telescope onto some surface. 
&gt; if you can&#039;t do any of the above, try using pin hole images - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera  

for those who do know and are ready to observe tomorrow in the morning starting from sunrise - well good luck and let&#039;s hope there is no cloud cover in the morning tomorrow.

1. how do the Romulans(villians) know if the person who came on their ship is indeed the captain and not the 1st/2nd officer of the human ship? they could&#039;ve been easily fooled
2. why didnt the romulan villian make peace with the fact that his planet was destroyed in the future infront of his own eyes and now, in the present go to his planet to warn them of the impending danger but instead chose to stay and wait at the same place in space waiting for spock to come through the wormhole! the latter was just dumb, u see anger blinds people !!
